Short description of the project.

List of Python packages used and their versions (e.g. numpy 1.21.5). This is good practice for reproducible and responsible programming!

Detailed description of the demo file. This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

System input: seed playlist title or initial set of songs in a playlist (we could set a default number but also allow number to be specified by user)
System output: a list of song recommendations to complete the playlist 
Intermediate steps:
Find other playlists within the data set that have similar titles or songs as the input
Isolate relevant data within these playlists (song titles, song names, and potentially song genres?)
Do something similar to homework 3 and the hamilton dataset, finding which songs appear most frequently within these other playlists
Select the top n songs and add them to the playlist inputted by the user at the beginning


Scope and limitations, including ethical implications, accessibility concerns, and ideas for potential extensions.
